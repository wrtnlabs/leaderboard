              "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to convert the given TypeScript function into a schema using the enrollFunction tool. Let me start by understanding what the function does. The function is called drawCircle, and it takes a props object with specific properties. The goal is to represent this in the required JSON schema format.\n\nFirst, the function's parameters are defined in the props object. The props has a type, center, and radius. The type is a string literal \"circle\", so that's straightforward. The center is an object with x and y, both numbers. The radius is a number with a minimum value of 0, which in TypeScript is represented using a tag like tags.Minimum<0>. But in the schema, I need to handle this constraint properly.\n\nLooking at the example provided earlier, the enrollFunction uses a JSON schema structure with $defs and properties. The parameters should be an object with properties and required fields. Each property in the parameters should have a type and possibly constraints.\n\nFor the type property in props, since it's a fixed value \"circle\", I'll set it as an enum with only \"circle\". The center is an object with x and y as numbers. Both x and y are required, so they should be in the required array. The radius is a number with a minimum of 0. However, the user mentioned that OpenAI doesn't support certain constraints directly, so instead, the description should include a comment like \"@minimum 0\".\n\nI also need to include the $defs section if there are nested objects. The center is an object, so it should be defined in $defs. But looking at the example, maybe it's better to inline it if possible, but the schema might require references. Wait, the example has a IChatGptSchema.IReference type for nested objects. But in the provided function, the center is inline. However, according to the rules, maybe nested objects need to be in $defs.\n\nWait, let me check the enrollFunction's parameters. The schema parameter is of type IChatGptSchema, which includes $defs for named types. So any nested objects should be defined in $defs and referenced using $ref. So the center object would be a separate definition in $defs, and referenced in the properties.\n\nBut in the given example, when they have a location in get_weather, they just inline the object. Wait, no, in the example, the parameters are simple. Maybe for nested objects, they need to be defined in $defs. Let me think. The user's example shows that for the get_weather function, the parameters are a simple object with location as a string. But in this case, center is an object with x and y. So according to the schema structure, I need to define the center as a separate schema in $defs and reference it.\n\nBut the user's example of IChatGptSchema shows that object properties can be defined inline. Wait, looking back at the IChatGptSchema.IObject, it has properties which can be a record of IChatGptSchema. So maybe the center can be an inline object without needing a $ref. However, according to the rules, OpenAI might not handle nested objects well, so perhaps it's better to define them in $defs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the schema can have the center as an inline object. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nThe function's parameters are:\n\nprops: {\n  type: \"circle\";\n  center: { x: number; y: number; };\n  radius: number & Minimum<0>;\n}\n\nSo in the schema, the parameters object should have properties for type, center, and radius. The required fields are all three.\n\nType: enum [\"circle\"]\nCenter: object with x and y (both numbers, required)\nRadius: number with minimum 0, but as per the instructions, instead of using minimum, we add a description with \"@minimum 0\".\n\nSo the parameters part would look like:\n\nparameters: {\n  type: \"object\",\n  properties: {\n    type: { type: \"string\", enum: [\"circle\"] },\n    center: {\n      type: \"object\",\n      properties: {\n        x: { type: \"number\" },\n        y: { type: \"number\" }\n      },\n      required: [\"x\", \"y\"]\n    },\n    radius: { \n      type: \"number\",\n      description: \"@minimum 0\"\n    }\n  },\n  required: [\"type\", \"center\", \"radius\"]\n}\n\nBut according to the IChatGptSchema rules, additionalProperties is set to false in strict mode. The example shows that in parameters, additionalProperties is set to false. So maybe in the parameters, we need to set additionalProperties: false.\n\nWait, looking at the enrollFunction's parameters schema, the parameters have additionalProperties set to false. So in the parameters object, we need to include additionalProperties: false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe schema for enrollFunction would be:\n\n{\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"name\": \"drawCircle\",\n    \"description\": \"Draw a circle with the given center and radius.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"enum\": [\"circle\"]\n        },\n        \"center\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"x\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n            \"y\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"x\", \"y\"],\n          \"additionalProperties\": false\n        },\n        \"radius\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"description\": \"@minimum 0\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"type\", \"center\", \"radius\"],\n      \"additionalProperties\": false\n    },\n    \"$defs\": {\n      // Do I need to define anything here? Since center is inline, maybe not. But if center is a reference, then yes. But in the example, it's inline.\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, but in the IChatGptSchema, the parameters are of type IParameters, which includes $defs. But in the given example, the parameters are defined inline. So perhaps the $defs are only needed for recursive or reused types. Since center is an inline object, maybe it's okay to define it inline without a $defs entry.\n\nHowever, looking at the enrollFunction example, the parameters can have nested objects without $defs. So maybe it's acceptable.\n\nAnother thing: the radius has a minimum of 0. Since OpenAI doesn't support minimum, we add the description \"@minimum 0\" as per the instructions.\n\nSo the final schema should have the parameters as described, with the center object inline, and radius with the description.\n\nThe function's name is drawCircle, and the description is \"Draw a circle with the given center and radius.\" from the JSDoc.\n\nSo putting it all together, the enrollFunction call would be:\n\n<tool_calls_begin><tool_call_begin>function<tool_sep>enrollFunction\n```json\n{\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"name\": \"drawCircle\",\n    \"description\": \"Draw a circle with the given center and radius.\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"enum\": [\"circle\"]\n        },\n        \"center\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"x\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n            \"y\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"x\", \"y\"],\n          \"additionalProperties\": false\n        },\n        \"radius\": {\n          \"type\": \"number\",\n          \"description\": \"@minimum 0\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"type\", \"center\", \"radius\"],\n      \"additionalProperties\": false\n    },\n    \"$defs\": {}\n  }\n}\n```<tool_call_end><tool_calls_end>\n",
