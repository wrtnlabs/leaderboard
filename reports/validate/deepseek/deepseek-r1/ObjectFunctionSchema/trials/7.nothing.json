A `type` property exactly equal to \"circle\"\n2. A `center` object with:\n   - Required numeric `x` and `y` properties\n   - No additional properties allowed in the center object\n3. A `radius` with minimum value of 0 (non-negative)\n4. No extra properties allowed in the main object\n5. All three properties (type, center, radius) are required",
          "refusal": null,
          "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to convert the given TypeScript function into a JSON schema. Hmm, the function is about drawing a circle with specific properties. So the schema should define the structure of the input parameters.\n\nFirst, looking at the TypeScript interface for the props. The props object has a 'type' field set to \"circle\", which is a constant. Then there's 'center' which is an object with x and y, both numbers. The 'radius' is a number that must be at least 0.\n\nIn JSON schema, I need to create a schema that enforces these constraints. The main schema will be an object with required properties: type, center, radius. The type should be \"circle\", so the enum or const keyword can be used. Center is another object with x and y as numbers. For radius, I should use minimum: 0, exclusiveMinimum might not be needed since the original uses Minimum<0>, which probably allows 0. Wait, TypeScript's & tags.Minimum<0> likely means the radius must be 0 or higher. So in JSON schema, \"minimum\": 0, and maybe \"exclusiveMinimum\": false? But by default, minimum is inclusive. So just set minimum to 0.\n\nSo putting it all together. Let me structure the schema:\n\n- type: object\n- properties:\n  - type: { const: \"circle\" }\n  - center: { type: object, properties: x and y as numbers, required: [\"x\", \"y\"] }\n  - radius: { type: number, minimum: 0 }\n- required: [\"type\", \"center\", \"radius\"]\n\nAlso, ensure there are no additional properties unless allowed. But the original function's props may have other fields, but probably not? The TypeScript function's props are fixed. Maybe set additionalProperties to false? Or maybe not. The original TypeScript allows extra properties unless they have excess property checks. But since it's a function parameter, if someone passes extra properties, TypeScript might error. So to replicate that, schema should have additionalProperties: false.\n\nWait, but in TypeScript when you pass object literals with extra properties, you get an error. However, if you pass an object variable with extra properties, it's allowed. So perhaps it's better not to set additionalProperties to false here. Unless the schema is meant to enforce exactly those properties, which might be safer. But the original code's function only expects those three properties, so maybe adding additionalProperties: false is better.\n\nI'm not sure. Let's check. The function's parameter is an object with type, center, radius. So in the schema, set additionalProperties: true or false? Maybe the user intends to not allow extra properties. To match the TypeScript interface more strictly, maybe they want to disallow extra properties. So the schema should have additionalProperties: false.\n\nSo the complete schema would be:\n\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"title\": \"drawCircle parameters\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"type\": {\n      \"const\": \"circle\"\n    },\n    \"center\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"x\": { \"type\": \"number\" },\n        \"y\": { \"type\": \"number\" }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"x\", \"y\"],\n      \"additionalProperties\": false\n    },\n    \"radius\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"type\", \"center\", \"radius\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\n\nYes, that seems correct. The 'type' is fixed to \"circle\", the center has x and y numbers, radius is a non-negative number. No extra properties allowed.\n"
