Let me know how you’d like to proceed!",

          "reasoning": "Okay, so this user wants to see sales in the market. First, I need to understand exactly what they're asking for. Are they looking for current sales data, historical trends, or projections? They didn't specify the market, so I should ask for clarification. Which market are they referring to? It could be a specific industry like tech, automotive, retail, or a geographical market like the US, Europe, or Asia. Also, what time frame are they interested in? Last quarter, year-to-date, or a specific period? \n\nI need to consider if they are an investor, a business owner, or maybe a student doing research. Each might require different data. Investors might want financial metrics and forecasts, while a business owner could be interested in competitors' performance or market share. Without more context, it's hard to tailor the response. \n\nI should also check if they need the data visualized, like charts or graphs, or just numerical data. Do they prefer a high-level overview or detailed breakdowns? Availability of data is another thing. Some markets have publicly available data, others might be proprietary. I might mention sources like Statista, Bloomberg, or government reports. \n\nIn case they don't have specifics, maybe provide a general example. For example, \"In Q2 2023, the global smartphone market saw a 7% decline in sales compared to the previous year.\" Then offer to narrow it down based on their needs. Be cautious about data accuracy; don't provide outdated or unverified info. Also, remind them that for real-time or highly specific data, specialized tools or subscriptions might be necessary. \n\nFinally, prompt them to provide more details so I can assist better. Maybe list possible options: industry, region, time frame, type of data. That way, they can specify without having to guess what info I need. Make sure the response is helpful but also guides them to give more context for a precise answer.\n"
