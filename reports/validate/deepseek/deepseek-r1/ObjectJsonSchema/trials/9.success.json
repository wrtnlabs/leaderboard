          "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to convert the given IMember TypeScript interface into a JSON schema using the collectSchema function. First, I need to understand the structure of the IMember interface. \n\nThe IMember has several properties: id, name, email, age, hobbies, created_at, updated_at, and deleted_at. Each of these has specific TypeScript types and tags that need to be translated into JSON schema constraints.\n\nStarting with the 'id' property. It's a string with a format of \"uuid\". In JSON schema, that would be a string type with a format attribute set to \"uuid\". \n\nNext, 'name' is a straightforward string, so that's simpleâ€”just a string type with no additional constraints. \n\nThe 'email' field is similar to 'id' but with a format of \"email\". So again, a string type with format: \"email\".\n\nThe 'age' is a number with Minimum<20> and ExclusiveMaximum<100>. In JSON schema, minimum is 20 and exclusiveMaximum is 100. Wait, but in JSON schema, exclusiveMaximum is a boolean if using the draft-04 style, but since the user provided a value, maybe they're using a different draft where exclusiveMaximum is a number. Wait, looking back at the parameters for collectSchema, there's a mention of OpenApi.IJsonSchema.INumber which has exclusiveMaximum as a boolean. Hmm, but the example given in the parameters for INumber shows exclusiveMaximum as a boolean, but the tags here are using Minimum and ExclusiveMaximum with values. Maybe there's a different way to handle this. Wait, the user's TypeScript uses tags.Minimum<20> and tags.ExclusiveMaximum<100>, which would translate to minimum: 20 and exclusiveMaximum: true, but then the maximum would be 100. Wait, perhaps in OpenAPI, exclusiveMaximum is a boolean, and maximum is the value. So for age, we set minimum: 20, maximum: 100, and exclusiveMaximum: true. That makes sense.\n\nThen 'hobbies' is an array of objects with 'id' (string format uuid) and 'name' (string). So in JSON schema, this would be an array where items are objects with those properties. The items schema would have the id and name as required properties.\n\nThe 'created_at' and 'updated_at' are strings with format \"date-time\". So string type with format: \"date-time\".\n\nThe 'deleted_at' is a union of null and a string with format \"date-time\". In JSON schema, this would be a oneOf with a null type and the string format. Alternatively, using nullable: true, but according to the OpenAPI specs, nullable is a separate property. Wait, looking at the parameters, the OpenApi.IJsonSchema has a nullable property in the __ISignificant.nullable. So maybe we need to represent this as a oneOf between null and the string. So the deleted_at would have oneOf: [ { type: 'null' }, { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' } ].\n\nPutting this all together, the JSON schema for IMember would be an object with required properties, each with their respective types and constraints.\n\nNow, using the collectSchema function provided, which expects a schema parameter. The schema should conform to the OpenApi.IJsonSchema structure. So the main schema is an object type with properties and required fields.\n\nLet me structure each property step by step:\n\n- id: { type: 'string', format: 'uuid' }\n- name: { type: 'string' }\n- email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' }\n- age: { type: 'number', minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: true, maximum: 100 }\n- hobbies: { \n  type: 'array',\n  items: {\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n      id: { type: 'string', format: 'uuid' },\n      name: { type: 'string' }\n    },\n    required: ['id', 'name']\n  }\n}\n- created_at: { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' }\n- updated_at: { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' }\n- deleted_at: {\n  oneOf: [\n    { type: 'null' },\n    { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' }\n  ]\n}\n\nThen, the required array would include all the property names except deleted_at if it's nullable. Wait, in the IMember interface, deleted_at is optional because it's allowed to be null? Or is it required but can be null? The TypeScript interface shows deleted_at as a property, so it's present but can be null. So in JSON schema, the 'deleted_at' would be part of the required list, but its schema allows null. However, using oneOf with null and the string would make it so that the value can be either null or a date-time string. Therefore, 'deleted_at' should be included in the required array.\n\nSo the required array would be ['id', 'name', 'email', 'age', 'hobbies', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'deleted_at'].\n\nWait, but in TypeScript, if a property is declared as deleted_at: null | ..., it means that the property exists but can be null. So in JSON schema, it's required, but the value can be null. Therefore, it's included in required.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON schema for IMember would look like:\n\n{\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n    id: { type: 'string', format: 'uuid' },\n    name: { type: 'string' },\n    email: { type: 'string', format: 'email' },\n    age: { type: 'number', minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: true, maximum: 100 },\n    hobbies: {\n      type: 'array',\n      items: {\n        type: 'object',\n        properties: {\n          id: { type: 'string', format: 'uuid' },\n          name: { type: 'string' }\n        },\n        required: ['id', 'name']\n      }\n    },\n    created_at: { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' },\n    updated_at: { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' },\n    deleted_at: {\n      oneOf: [\n        { type: 'null' },\n        { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  required: ['id', 'name', 'email', 'age', 'hobbies', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'deleted_at']\n}\n\nNow, using the collectSchema function, which takes this schema as the parameter. So the tool call would be to collectSchema with this schema.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the schema conforms to the OpenApi.IJsonSchema structure as defined in the parameters. For example, the 'exclusiveMaximum' in the age property should be a boolean, and 'maximum' is the value. Wait, looking back at the parameters for the INumber type, the exclusiveMaximum is a boolean, and maximum is a number. So for age, the exclusiveMaximum is true, and maximum is 100. So the age property would have:\n\n\"maximum\": 100,\n\"exclusiveMaximum\": true\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlso, the 'deleted_at' uses oneOf with null and the string. According to the OpenApi.IJsonSchema, the oneOf is allowed as part of the IOneOf type. So the deleted_at's schema is a oneOf array with the two options.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON schema should be correctly structured. Then, the collectSchema function is called with this schema as the parameter.\n",
