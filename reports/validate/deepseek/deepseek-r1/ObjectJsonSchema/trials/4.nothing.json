          "reasoning": "Alright, let's tackle converting the given TypeScript interface IMember into a JSON Schema. First, I need to recall how JSON Schema works and how TypeScript types map to JSON Schema structures. \n\nLooking at the interface, each property has a base type and some tags that seem to define additional constraints. The user mentioned things like tags.Format<\"uuid\"> or tags.Minimum<20>, which I think are used here to specify formats and numeric constraints. My job is to translate these into the corresponding JSON Schema keywords.\n\nStarting with the 'id' field. It's a string with a format of uuid. In JSON Schema, that would be { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }. Similarly, the 'email' has a format of email. The 'age' is a number with minimum 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. For that, I'll use \"minimum\": 20 and \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100. \n\nThe 'hobbies' property is an array of objects. Each object has an 'id' (string with uuid format) and a 'name' (string). So the items in the array would be a schema with those properties. That translates to a \"type\": \"array\" with \"items\" containing the respective schema.\n\nFor date-time formats, 'created_at', 'updated_at', and 'deleted_at' have the \"date-time\" format. The 'deleted_at' can also be null, which means the schema should include \"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"] and the format applies when it's a string. Wait, but JSON Schema allows for multiple types as an array, but the format keyword only applies if the type is a string, right? So for 'deleted_at', the schema would be { type: [\"string\", \"null\"], format: \"date-time\" }? Hmm, but the original TypeScript has it as a union of null and (string & ...). So maybe that's correct. Although in JSON Schema, when type is an array, the format is checked only when the type is string. So that's okay.\n\nNow, about reusing components. Since the 'id' with uuid format appears in the main schema and inside hobbies, perhaps we should create a $defs section with a reusable definition for the uuid string. Similarly, the object inside hobbies has an 'id' (uuid) and 'name', so maybe create a definition for 'hobby' to reuse. But the problem says to collect it for reusing. Let me check the original code again. The IMember interface includes a hobbies array that has objects with id (uuid) and name. So maybe in the definitions, we can create a 'hobby' schema and reference it. The same with the uuid and email formats, if they occur in multiple places, but in this case, the uuid is used in 'id' and in hobby's id. So yes, we can make a $def for UUIDString.\n\nWait, but in JSON Schema, $defs (formerly definitions) allows creating reusable schemas. So that's the approach. Let's outline steps:\n\n1. Create a top-level JSON Schema with $schema, title, type, properties, required, etc.\n\n2. For fields with special formats or constraints:\n   - id: UUID, so reference a $defs.uuid string.\n   - email: uses format email, so a string with format.\n   - age: number with min and exclusiveMax. So schema is type: number, minimum:20, exclusiveMaximum:100.\n\n3. For hobbies: array of objects. Each object is like { id: uuid, name: string }, so create a $defs.hobby with properties id (ref to uuid) and name (string). Then hobbies becomes an array of $ref to #/$defs/hobby.\n\n4. The date-time fields (created_at, updated_at) are string with date-time format. Deleted_at can be null or string with date-time. So, for deleted_at, the type is [\"string\", \"null\"], format: \"date-time\". But in some JSON Schema validators, the format may be ignored when the type is not a string, so I should specify that if the type is string, then the format applies. So perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together, the schema would start with the $schema, title, then the main properties. Then in $defs, we have the uuid definition (string, format uuid), and the hobby schema (with id ref to uuid and name string). \n\nWait, but the hobby object doesn't have any other references except in the hobbies array, so that's necessary. Now, making sure all tags are converted. \n\nFor the 'age' field, in the TypeScript it's number with tags.Minimum<20> and tags.ExclusiveMaximum<100>. In JSON Schema, those map to \"minimum\": 20 and \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100. Need to confirm if tags.ExclusiveMaximum is exclusive, yes, so in JSON Schema exclusiveMaximum is correct.\n\nSo the final schema should have these components. Now, composing all of that. Also, adding all the required properties. The required array would include all the keys except 'deleted_at' which allows null. Wait, in the TypeScript, all properties like id, name, email are required unless they have a '?' (optional). Since the given interface doesn't show any as optional, all are required except 'deleted_at', which can be null, but it's present (as a property in the object), since in TypeScript even if it's null, it's a property. Wait, the original IMember interface's 'deleted_at' is of type null | (string & ...). So in JSON terms, if the property is present, it can be null or a date-time string.\n\nSo in JSON Schema, all the properties except maybe 'deleted_at' are required. But in the interface, the properties are: id, name, email, age, hobbies, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at. None are optional, so in the required array, all these properties are present. Because even though deleted_at can be null, it's still required that the property exists (as per the interface). Therefore, all properties are required.\n\nSo the required array in JSON Schema should include all these keys: [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"].\n\nNow, writing out each property:\n\n- id: { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UUID\" }\n- name: { type: \"string\" }\n- email: { type: \"string\", format: \"email\" }\n- age: { type: \"number\", minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: 100 }\n- hobbies: { type: \"array\", items: { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Hobby\" } }\n- created_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n- updated_at: same as created_at.\n- deleted_at: { type: [\"string\", \"null\"], format: \"date-time\" }\n\nWait, but the $defs: \n\n- UUID: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }\n- Hobby: { type: \"object\", properties: { id: { $ref: \"#/$defs/UUID\" }, name: { type: \"string\" } }, required: [\"id\", \"name\"] }\n\nYes, since the hobby object's properties are required.\n\nPutting it all into JSON Schema, with all the parts. Also, including the $schema if necessary, typically you have $schema: \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\" to specify the dialect. But the user didn't specify, but using draft 7 or 2020-12 would be a good idea.\n\nSo final JSON Schema structure:\n\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"$id\": \"member.schema.json\",\n  \"title\": \"Member\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UUID\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 20, \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100 },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/Hobby\" }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"updated_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"],\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"],\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"UUID\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\n    },\n    \"Hobby\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/UUID\" },\n        \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, but \"deleted_at\" has \"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"], but in JSON Schema, the \"null\" type is allowed. However, the format applies to the string part, right? So if the value is null, the format is ignored. That's correct.\n\nAlso, in the $defs section, 'Hobby' is properly defined with required properties.\n\nThis should cover all aspects of the original interface.\n"
