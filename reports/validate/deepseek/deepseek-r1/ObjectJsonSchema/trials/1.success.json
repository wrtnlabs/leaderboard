          "reasoning": "Okay, I need to convert the given IMember TypeScript interface into a JSON schema using the collectSchema function. Let me start by understanding the structure of the IMember interface.\n\nFirst, the IMember has several properties:\n- id is a string with a UUID format.\n- name is a regular string.\n- email is a string with an email format.\n- age is a number that's at least 20 and less than 100.\n- hobbies is an array of objects, each with an id (UUID) and name (string).\n- created_at and updated_at are date-time formatted strings.\n- deleted_at can be null or a date-time string.\n\nFor each property, I need to map the TypeScript types and tags to the corresponding JSON schema attributes. The collectSchema function expects a schema parameter that matches the OpenApi.IJsonSchema structure.\n\nStarting with the id property. In JSON schema, a string with a format is straightforward. So:\n- type: \"string\"\n- format: \"uuid\"\n\nSimilarly, email would be a string with format \"email\". Age is a number with minimum 20 and exclusiveMaximum 100. That translates to:\n- type: \"number\"\n- minimum: 20\n- exclusiveMaximum: true\n- maximum: 100\n\nThe hobbies array contains objects. Each object has id (UUID string) and name (string). So the items for the hobbies array would be an object schema with those properties. The array itself would have type \"array\" and items pointing to that object schema.\n\nFor created_at and updated_at, they are date-time strings, so format: \"date-time\".\n\nDeleted_at is a union of null and date-time string. In JSON schema, this would be a oneOf with two options: a null type and a string with date-time format. But since OpenApi merges anyOf into oneOf, I should represent this as a oneOf array containing both schemas.\n\nPutting it all together, the main schema for IMember is an object with properties and required fields. Each property's schema is defined as per above.\n\nI also need to ensure that all the nested schemas are correctly referenced. For example, the hobbies array's items should be the schema for the hobby object. Since collectSchema is for reusing schemas, perhaps the hobby object should be defined as a separate schema, but since it's inline in the array, maybe it's included directly.\n\nWait, the collectSchema function's parameter is a schema that includes all necessary definitions. So the hobbies.items would be an object schema with id and name properties, each with their respective formats.\n\nNow, checking for any possible mistakes. For age, the original TypeScript uses tags.Minimum<20> and tags.ExclusiveMaximum<100>. In JSON schema, exclusiveMaximum can be a boolean with a maximum value. So setting exclusiveMaximum: true and maximum: 100 would make the age less than 100.\n\nFor deleted_at, since it's a union of null and date-time string, the oneOf array should include a null type and the string with format. But in OpenApi.IJsonSchema, the oneOf is used for union types.\n\nPutting all this into the collectSchema function's parameters, the schema should be an object with type \"object\", properties, required, and any additional definitions if needed.\n\nI should also make sure that all required fields are listed. In IMember, all properties except deleted_at are required (since deleted_at is nullable, but in the interface, unless marked optional with ?, they are required). Wait, in the given interface, all properties like id, name, etc., are mandatory unless specified otherwise. So in the JSON schema, required should include all except deleted_at? Wait, looking back at the interface:\n\nThe IMember interface has:\n\nid: string & ... (no question mark, so required)\nname: string (required)\nemail: required\nage: required\nhobbies: required\ncreated_at: required\nupdated_at: required\ndeleted_at: required but can be null.\n\nWait, in TypeScript, if a property is declared without a question mark, it's required. So in the interface, deleted_at is a required property, but its type allows null. Therefore, in the JSON schema, deleted_at is required, but can be null or a date-time string.\n\nTherefore, the required array in the schema should include all the property names: id, name, email, age, hobbies, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.\n\nNow, constructing the JSON schema:\n\nThe main object has properties for each field. Each property's schema is as follows:\n\n- id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }\n- name: { type: \"string\" }\n- email: { type: \"string\", format: \"email\" }\n- age: { type: \"number\", minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: true, maximum: 100 }\n- hobbies: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"object\", properties: { id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }, name: { type: \"string\" } }, required: [\"id\", \"name\"] } }\n- created_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n- updated_at: same as created_at\n- deleted_at: { oneOf: [ { type: \"null\" }, { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" } ] }\n\nBut in OpenApi.IJsonSchema, the oneOf would be used for unions. So for deleted_at, it's a oneOf array with two elements: a schema of type \"null\" and a schema of type \"string\" with format.\n\nPutting this all together into the collectSchema function's parameter.\n\nNow, the collectSchema function's parameter is a schema object that includes all these properties. The function is supposed to collect this schema for reuse, so the main schema is the IMember object.\n\nI need to structure this according to the OpenApi.IJsonSchema structure provided in the function's parameters. For example, the object type has properties, required, etc.\n\nSo the final JSON schema should look like:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n    \"age\": { \n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 20,\n      \"exclusiveMaximum\": true,\n      \"maximum\": 100\n    },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n          \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"updated_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"oneOf\": [\n        { \"type\": \"null\" },\n        { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"]\n}\n\nI need to make sure that this schema is passed as the \"schema\" parameter to collectSchema. So the tool call should be collectSchema with this schema.\n\nBut wait, the function's parameters for collectSchema are defined as:\n\nparameters: {\n  \"schema\": { ... } // the JSON schema to collect\n}\n\nSo the tool call should be collectSchema with the schema parameter set to the above object.\n\nI need to format this correctly in JSON within the tool call syntax.\n\nAlso, note that in OpenApi.IJsonSchema, the \"exclusiveMaximum\" is a boolean, and the actual maximum is set in \"maximum\". So for age, exclusiveMaximum: true and maximum: 100 is correct.\n\nFinally, the required array includes all the property names since they are all mandatory in the interface.\n",
