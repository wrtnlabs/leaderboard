          "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to figure out how to convert the given TypeScript interface IMember into a JSON schema using the collectSchema function. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the IMember interface. It has several properties with various TypeScript types and tags. The goal is to map each of these properties to the corresponding JSON schema definitions based on the OpenAPI specifications provided in the tool's parameters.\n\nStarting with the 'id' property: it's a string with a uuid format. In JSON schema, this would be a string type with the format set to \"uuid\". The 'name' and 'email' are also strings, with email having the \"email\" format. \n\nThe 'age' property is a number with minimum 20 and exclusive maximum 100. According to the schema definitions, minimum and maximum are properties under the number type. Since it's exclusive maximum, the exclusiveMaximum boolean should be true, and maximum would be 100. Similarly, minimum is 20.\n\nThe 'hobbies' property is an array of objects with 'id' and 'name'. Each object in the array should have properties defined as per their types. The array itself would use the items keyword to specify the schema for its elements.\n\nThe 'created_at' and 'updated_at' are date-time strings, so format is \"date-time\". The 'deleted_at' is a union of null and date-time string, which in JSON schema would be a oneOf with a null type and a string with format. Alternatively, since OpenAPI might handle nullable via a property, but looking at the provided schema, the IJsonSchema has a oneOf for union types. So, deleted_at would be a oneOf array containing the null type and the string with format.\n\nNow, considering the collectSchema function's parameters, the schema should be structured according to the OpenAPI.IJsonSchema definitions. Each property in the IMember interface needs to be translated into the appropriate JSON schema type, using the correct keywords like type, format, minimum, exclusiveMaximum, etc.\n\nFor the 'hobbies' array, the items would be an object schema with 'id' and 'name' properties. The array's schema would have type: \"array\", items pointing to that object schema.\n\nPutting it all together, the top-level schema for IMember is an object with properties corresponding to each field. Each field's schema is defined as per their TypeScript types and tags. The required array lists all the mandatory properties, which in this case are all except 'deleted_at' since it can be null.\n\nI also need to ensure that the JSON schema uses the correct $ref and structure as per the collectSchema function's expected input. The collectSchema function seems to take a schema parameter which is the JSON schema to collect. So the main schema would be under the \"schema\" key in the function's parameters.\n\nWait, looking at the collectSchema parameters, it's expecting a schema of type OpenApi.IJsonSchema. So the generated schema must conform to that structure. For example, the 'age' property would be of type \"number\" with minimum 20 and exclusiveMaximum set to true, and maximum 100.\n\nThe 'deleted_at' is a union of null and a formatted string. In the OpenAPI schema, this would be a oneOf array containing a null type (type: \"null\") and a string with format: \"date-time\". \n\nLet me check the OpenAPI.IJsonSchema.IOneOf definition. The oneOf property is an array of schemas, each of which is a possible type. So for 'deleted_at', the oneOf would have two elements: one with type \"null\" and another with type \"string\" and format \"date-time\".\n\nPutting all these together, the final JSON schema should correctly represent each property with their respective constraints. Also, the required array should include all properties except those that are optional. In the given IMember interface, all properties except 'deleted_at' are required because they don't have optional markers (like '?'). Wait, looking at the IMember interface, all properties are required unless they have a '?' which they don't. So 'deleted_at' is of type null | string, but it's still a required property that can be null. So in the required array, all properties including 'deleted_at' are present.\n\nWait, in TypeScript, if a property is declared without a question mark, it's required. So even if it can be null, it's still required to be present. Therefore, 'deleted_at' is a required property that can be either null or a date-time string. So in the JSON schema, 'deleted_at' is required, and its schema allows null or the string.\n\nTherefore, the required array includes all the property names: id, name, email, age, hobbies, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.\n\nNow, translating each property:\n\n- id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }\n- name: { type: \"string\" }\n- email: { type: \"string\", format: \"email\" }\n- age: { type: \"number\", minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: true, maximum: 100 }\n- hobbies: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"object\", properties: { id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" }, name: { type: \"string\" } }, required: [\"id\", \"name\"] } }\n- created_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n- updated_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n- deleted_at: { oneOf: [ { type: \"null\" }, { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" } ] }\n\nBut wait, the OpenAPI schema might handle nullable differently. Looking at the provided OpenAPI.IJsonSchema, there's a INull type with type: \"null\". So for 'deleted_at', it's a oneOf between a null type and the string with format.\n\nPutting it all together into the collectSchema function's parameters, the final JSON schema should be structured correctly under the \"schema\" key. Also, the required array lists all property names.\n\nI need to make sure that all the OpenAPI schema definitions are correctly applied, such as using the correct keywords for exclusiveMaximum (which is a boolean) and maximum (the value). For example, the 'age' field has exclusiveMaximum: true and maximum: 100.\n\nAnother point is the 'hobbies' array's items. Each item is an object with 'id' and 'name', both required. So the items schema has properties and required fields.\n\nNow, assembling the entire JSON schema:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n    \"age\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 20, \"exclusiveMaximum\": true, \"maximum\": 100 },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n          \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"updated_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"oneOf\": [\n        { \"type\": \"null\" },\n        { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"]\n}\n\nThis should be passed as the \"schema\" parameter to the collectSchema function. So the tool call would be to collectSchema with this schema.\n\nNow, checking the function signature for collectSchema, it expects a parameter called \"schema\" which is of type OpenApi.IJsonSchema. The generated schema here should conform to that structure.\n\nI need to ensure that all the types are correctly mapped, using the correct OpenAPI schema definitions. For example, the 'exclusiveMaximum' is a boolean, and 'maximum' is the value. The 'oneOf' for 'deleted_at' is correctly structured as an array of schemas.\n\nFinally, the required array includes all the property names, as none are optional in the original interface.\n",
