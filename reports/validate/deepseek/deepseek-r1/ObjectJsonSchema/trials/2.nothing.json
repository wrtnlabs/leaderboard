Reusable components defined in `$defs` for:\n   - UUID format (`uuid`)\n   - Email format (`email`)\n   - DateTime format (`dateTime`)\n   - Nullable DateTime (`dateTimeNullable`)\n   - Hobby object schema (`hobby`)\n\n2. Schema uses JSON Schema Draft 7 features like:\n   - `format` for semantic validation\n   - `exclusiveMaximum` for range validation\n   - Array type validation\n   - Nullable type handling\n\n3. All interface properties are marked as required in the main schema\n\n4. The `deleted_at` field uses a union type with a format constraint that only applies when the value is a string\n\nYou can reference these definitions in other schemas using `$ref` pointers like `#/$defs/uuid` to maintain consistency across your API contracts.",
          "refusal": null,
          "reasoning": "Okay, I need to convert the TypeScript interface IMember into a JSON schema. Let me look at each property and see how to map the TypeScript types and tags to JSON Schema keywords.\n\nStarting with the 'id' property. The type is a string with a tag Format<\"uuid\">. In JSON Schema, this becomes a string with a format of \"uuid\". So { type: 'string', format: 'uuid' }.\n\nNext, 'name' is a simple string, so { type: 'string' }.\n\nThe 'email' has a Format<\"email\">, so similar to 'id' but format is 'email'. So type string, format email.\n\nFor 'age', it's a number with Minimum<20> and ExclusiveMaximum<100>. JSON Schema uses 'minimum' and 'exclusiveMaximum' for these. Wait, TypeScript uses tags named Minimum and ExclusiveMaximum. So I think the minimum is inclusive, but if it's exclusiveMaximum, that's exclusive. So age should have minimum: 20 and exclusiveMaximum: 100. Therefore, { type: 'number', minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: 100 }.\n\nHobbies is an array of objects. Each object has 'id' (string, uuid) and 'name' (string). So the items schema would be a object with properties for id and name. The array schema would have type 'array' and items set to this object schema.\n\nNow 'created_at' and 'updated_at' are both strings with date-time format. So type string, format date-time. For 'deleted_at', it's a union of null and a date-time string. So the JSON Schema needs to allow null or a date-time string. In JSON Schema, you can use 'type' as ['null', 'string'] and the format applies when it's a string. But I need to set the format only if it's a string. So maybe use anyOf with one schema { type: 'null' } and another { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' }? Or use 'type' as an array with both types. Wait, in JSON Schema, if you have multiple types, you can use \"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"] and for the string case, apply the format. Wait, how does that work? Let me check. For type being an array, the instance must be one of those. So, if 'deleted_at' can be null or a string with date-time, then the schema would have:\n\ntype: [\"string\", \"null\"],\nformat: \"date-time\"\n\nBut wait, the format applies only when the type is string. So I think that works. So, { type: ['string', 'null'], format: 'date-time' } would imply that if it's a string, then it must be a date-time, and if it's null, that's okay. Let me confirm if that's valid. Oh wait, in JSON Schema draft 7 and above, the format keyword applies to the instance only when the type is a string. So in this case, when type allows multiple types, the format is only checked when the actual type is a string. So that's okay.\n\nNow, for reusability, perhaps the nested object in hobbies can have a $ref to a reusable schema. Looking at the hobbies array's items, which have id and name (similar to the IMember's id?), but id in the hobby is another uuid. So perhaps define a 'Hobby' schema in the definitions, or components/schemas. However, the original request says to \"collect it for reusing\", so maybe the hobby object should be a reusable component. Therefore, in the JSON schema, we can have a 'definitions' section (for draft 7) or '$defs' (for 2019-09 or 2020-12). Since the user didn't specify a draft, I'll assume using the latest structure, so using '$defs'. So the hobby object schema would be a separate entry in $defs.\n\nBut I need to check how to reference it. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the overall schema would be:\n\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"title\": \"IMember\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/uuidString\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n    \"age\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 20,\n      \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n    },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/hobby\" }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTimeString\" },\n    \"updated_at\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTimeString\" },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"],\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"],\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"uuidString\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\n    },\n    \"dateTimeString\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"hobby\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/uuidString\" },\n        \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, but in the 'deleted_at' property. Is it required? Looking at the original interface, 'deleted_at' is present as a property (since all properties in TypeScript interfaces are required unless marked optional with '?'), so in JSON schema, they would be part of the 'required' array.\n\nWait, looking back: the original IMember has 'deleted_at' as a required property (since there's no question mark). But in JSON Schema, the 'required' array should include all properties that are mandatory. So the member object has all the properties listed as required. Therefore, 'deleted_at' is required here. Even though it can be null, it must be present in the JSON. So the JSON Schema's required array includes 'deleted_at'.\n\nBut since in TypeScript, when the property is optional (like deleted_at?: ...), it's not required. However, here 'deleted_at' is not optional. So it's required, but can be null. Hence, in JSON Schema, the presence is required and the value can be null or a date-time string.\n\nOkay, that's covered.\n\nIn the hobbies array items, the 'hobby' schema is defined in $defs. Each hobby has 'id' and 'name' as required. Makes sense.\n\nBut the 'id' property of the hobby uses uuidString from $defs. Therefore, that's reusable.\n\nAlso, 'created_at' and 'updated_at' are using the dateTimeString from $defs.\n\nWait, in the current setup I wrote:\n\n\"created_at\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTimeString\" }\n\nWhich is a reference to the dateTimeString schema which is:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"format\": \"date-time\"\n}\n\nThat's correct.\n\nBut 'deleted_at' is handled as:\n\n\"type\": [\"string\", \"null\"],\n\"format\": \"date-time\"\n\nBut why not define this in $defs? For reusability. But since this one allows null and is only used once, perhaps it's better to define it inline. However, if there's another property in another schema that has the same structure, maybe define a 'nullableDateTime' in $defs. But the original question says to collect it for reusing, but 'deleted_at' is the only one here that uses this pattern. So maybe inline is okay. However, perhaps the user wants to also make the nullable types reusable? Maybe not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in $defs, create 'nullableDateTimeString' with the type array and format. But let's see.\n\nBut the original question says, collect for reuse. Perhaps the original intention is to handle the formats as reusable components, like using $defs for uuid, email, datetime, etc., since those formats are reused in 'id', 'email', 'created_at', etc.\n\nSo in the current $defs, uuidString is reused by id and hobby.id. dateTimeString is used by created_at, updated_at, and the deleted_at's string part.\n\nNow, deleted_at is a union of null and date-time string. So to represent that, perhaps in the schema, 'deleted_at' has type [\"string\", \"null\"], and the format applies only when it's a string. Which is correct.\n\nSo that makes the current structure acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the JSON schema now correctly represents the IMember interface, using $defs to define reusable components for uuid strings, date-time strings, and the hobby object structure.\n\nI should also check that all the necessary properties are marked as required. For example, in the hobby object, the 'id' and 'name' are required, which they are in $defs.hobby.required.\n\nThe main schema's required includes all the properties of IMember, which makes sense since the interface has no optional properties.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON schema should look something like this:\n\nIncluding the $schema, title, type, properties, required, and $defs with reusable components.\n"
