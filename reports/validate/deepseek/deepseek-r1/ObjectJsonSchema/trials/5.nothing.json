Reusable components (`uuid`, `email`, `dateTime`, `hobby`) are defined in `$defs`\n2. Special formats use JSON Schema `format` keyword\n3. Nullable `deleted_at` is implemented using `anyOf`\n4. Age constraints use `minimum` and `exclusiveMaximum`\n5. All original interface fields are maintained as required properties\n6. Array type for hobbies with object items reference\n\nThis schema validates:\n- UUID formats for identifiers\n- Email and date-time formats\n- Age boundaries (20 â‰¤ age < 100)\n- Proper object structure for hobbies\n- Nullable date-time field for deletion timestamp",
          "refusal": null,
          "reasoning": "Okay, let me try to convert this TypeScript interface IMember into a JSON schema. First, I need to understand each property and the constraints applied.\n\nStarting with the 'id' field. It's a string with a format tag of 'uuid'. In JSON schema, that would translate to \"type\": \"string\" and \"format\": \"uuid\". \n\nNext is 'name', which is a straightforward string without any extra constraints, so just \"type\": \"string\".\n\nThe 'email' has a format of 'email', similar to 'id'. So again, \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\".\n\nThe 'age' is a number with tags Minimum 20 and ExclusiveMaximum 100. For Minimum, that's \"minimum\": 20. Since it's exclusive maximum, the JSON schema uses \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100. So the age property should have those validations.\n\nHobbies are an array of objects. Each object has an 'id' with uuid format and a 'name' string. I'll need to create a schema for each hobby item. Then, the hobbies array will have \"type\": \"array\" and \"items\" referencing the hobby schema.\n\n'created_at' and 'updated_at' are both date-time formatted strings. 'deleted_at' can be null or a date-time string. In JSON schema, null isn't a type, so we use \"type\": [\"null\", \"string\"] with \"format\": \"date-time\" when it's a string. Wait, actually, looking into JSON schema specs, to allow null, the type should include \"null\". But JSON schema itself allows nulls via \"type\": \"null\", but here deleted_at can be either null or a string with format. So the schema for deleted_at would be: \"type\": [\"null\", \"string\"], and then in the \"string\" part, apply the format? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, in JSON schema, if the type is an array with multiple types, we need to handle each case. So for \"deleted_at\", the type is [\"null\", \"string\"], but then how to apply the format only when it's a string. Oh right, you can use \"anyOf\" with different subschemas. So it would be:\n\n\"deleted_at\": {\n  \"anyOf\": [\n    { \"type\": \"null\" },\n    { \n      \"type\": \"string\", \n      \"format\": \"date-time\" \n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nAlternatively, maybe in newer versions of JSON Schema, we can use \"oneOf\" but anyOf might be better here. But I think using \"anyOf\" with the two options is the right approach.\n\nNow about reusing the schemas. There are some repeated structures. The uuid format string appears in 'id' and in hobbies' items' id. The date-time strings are used in multiple places. So maybe define these as separate schemas in $defs and reference them with $ref.\n\nLet's plan the $defs. Have a definition for 'uuid' which is a string with format uuid. Then a definition for 'email' which is a string with format email. A definition for 'dateTime' (string with date-time format). Also, the hobby object can be a separate schema to reference.\n\nSo in $defs:\n\n\"uuid\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n\"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n\"dateTime\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n\"hobby\": {\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/uuid\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n}\n\nThen the main schema would reference these. The 'id' uses $ref to uuid, 'email' to email, 'created_at' and 'updated_at' to dateTime. 'deleted_at' is a combination of null and dateTime. The hobbies array has items that $ref to hobby.\n\nFor age: minimum 20 and exclusiveMaximum 100: \n\n\"age\": {\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"minimum\": 20,\n  \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n}\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON schema would look like this:\n\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/uuid\" },\n    \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n    \"email\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/email\" },\n    \"age\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 20,\n      \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n    },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/hobby\" }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTime\" },\n    \"updated_at\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTime\" },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"anyOf\": [\n        { \"type\": \"null\" },\n        { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/dateTime\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\", \"deleted_at\"],\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"uuid\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n    \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n    \"dateTime\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n    \"hobby\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": { \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/uuid\" },\n        \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n      },\n      \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWait, but what about the required properties for the main object? The original interface IMember probably requires all the properties except maybe deleted_at? Let's check the IMember:\n\nLooking at the original definition:\n\ndeleted_at: null | (string & ...). So deleted_at is allowed to be present but can be null. In JSON schema, all properties are optional by default. But the original TypeScript interface would have all properties as required unless marked with '?'. Since the interface lists all properties without a question mark, they are all required. Therefore, in JSON schema, the \"required\" array includes all property names: id, name, email, age, hobbies, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at.\n\nBut will the 'hobbies' array accept an empty array? The schema only specifies that it's an array where each item is a hobby. The original IMember's 'hobbies' is an array; the TypeScript array type doesn't restrict it to non-empty, so even an empty array would be valid. So in JSON schema, no minItems is set.\n\nNow, just verify all the required fields are included and correctly mapped.\n\nAnother thing to check is the 'tags.Format<\"date-time\">, etc. Since JSON Schema doesn't know the 'tags' namespace from TypeScript, so in the conversion, we use the \"format\" keyword with the appropriate values.\n\nAlso, for the 'ExclusiveMaximum' in age, which is a number. JSON schema has 'exclusiveMaximum' as a boolean or a number? Wait, in JSON Schema draft 6 and above, 'exclusiveMaximum' is a number, and the value is the maximum where the value must be less than (not less than or equal). So in the user's tags.ExclusiveMaximum<100> translates to \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100. Which is correct as per the current approach.\n\nYes, so putting exclusiveMaximum: 100 correctly captures that age must be less than 100.\n\nTherefore, the resulting JSON schema should look like as written above.\n"
