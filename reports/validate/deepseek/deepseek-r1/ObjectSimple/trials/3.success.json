          "reasoning": "Okay, the user provided a scenario where a member needs to be joined to a channel. Let me look at the parameters required for the 'join' function. The parameters include 'id', 'name', and 'age'. The user gave the member's id as \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name as \"Eulchan Kim\", and age as 20. \n\nFirst, I need to check if the id is in the correct UUID format. The example they provided seems to match a standard UUID structure, so that's good. The name \"Eulchan Kim\" is a string, which fits the required type. The age is 20, which is an integer. The function's parameters specify that age should be a minimum of 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. Since 20 is the minimum, it's acceptable. \n\nI should structure the JSON object with these values. Each key must be present: id, name, and age. No additional properties are allowed. Let me make sure there are no typos in the keys. Then, I'll format it correctly within the tool call tags as specified.\n\nPutting it all together, the tool call should include the function name 'join' and the JSON object with the member's details. I need to ensure the JSON is properly indented and enclosed within triple backticks. Let me double-check everything to avoid any errors in syntax or data types.\n",
