The member's details are provided: id is \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name is \"Eulchan Kim\", and age is 20.\n\nFirst, I need to use the 'join' function. Let me check the parameters required. The schema mentions an object with id, name, and age. The id must be a UUID, the name a string, and age an integer between 20 and 100 (exclusive maximum 100). The given age is 20, which is the minimum allowed. That's valid.\n\nSo, I need to structure the JSON with these three fields. The id is correct as a UUID. Name is a valid string. Age is 20, which meets the criteria. No issues here. Just need to format the tool call correctly.\n\nWait, the example shows using <tool_calls_begin> and <tool_call_begin> with function name. So the syntax should be:\n\n<tool_calls_begin>\n<tool_call_begin>function<tool_sep>join\n```json\n{\"id\": \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", \"name\": \"Eulchan Kim\", \"age\": 20}\n```\n<tool_call_end>\n<tool_calls_end>\n\nI should make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values match the required types. Let me double-check. The parameters are id (string), name (string), age (integer). All look good. The age is 20, which is exactly the minimum, so that's acceptable. No typos in the id or name. \n\nEverything seems in order. Time to put it all together in the specified format.\n",
