The function provided is called \"join\", and the parameters require an object with those properties.\n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters for the join function. The schema says the parameters are an object with id (string, UUID format), name (string), and age (integer, minimum 20, exclusive maximum 100). \n\nThe user provided the ID as \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", which looks like a valid UUID. The name is \"Eulchan Kim\", which is a string. The age is 20, which meets the minimum of 20 and is less than 100. \n\nSo all the required fields are present and meet the validation criteria. I should structure the JSON according to the parameters. The order of properties doesn't matter in JSON, but it's good to list them as required. The required fields are id, name, and age, so all are there.\n\nI need to make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. The age is an integer, so no quotes around it. The id and name are strings, so they need quotes. \n\nPutting it all together, the tool call should use the join function with the provided member details. I'll structure the JSON accordingly and make sure there are no syntax errors.\n",
