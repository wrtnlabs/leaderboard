They want to join this member to the channel.\n\nI need to use the 'join' function. The parameters for 'join' require an object with id, name, and age. The ID must be a UUID, which the user provided correctly. The name is a string, which \"Eulchan Kim\" is. The age is an integer with a minimum of 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. Here, age is 20, which meets the criteria.\n\nSo, I'll structure the JSON with these values. Let me check each field again. ID is a valid UUID, name is a string, age is 20. All required fields are present. No additional properties are allowed, so just id, name, age. Looks good. Ready to format the tool call.\n",
