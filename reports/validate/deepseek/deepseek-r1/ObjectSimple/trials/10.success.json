The id must be a UUID, name is a string, and age is an integer with a minimum of 20 and less than 100.\n\nThe user provided the id as \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", which looks like a valid UUID. The name is \"Eulchan Kim\", which is a string. The age is 20, which meets the minimum requirement. \n\nI need to structure the JSON correctly. Let me make sure all required fields are included and formatted properly. The JSON should have the id, name, and age. No additional properties are allowed. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should be valid. Let me double-check the syntax: quotes around strings, commas between key-value pairs, and correct braces. Everything seems in order. Time to output the tool call as specified.\n",
