The member's details are provided: ID is \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name is \"Eulchan Kim\", and age is 20. I need to use the 'join' function here.\n\nFirst, I check the parameters required for the join function. The parameters schema specifies that the member must have id, name, and age. The id should be a UUID, which the provided ID is. The name is a string, which \"Eulchan Kim\" is. The age is an integer with a minimum of 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. The member's age is 20, which meets the criteria.\n\nSo, I need to structure the JSON payload correctly. The required fields are all present. Let me format the JSON with the given data. Make sure there are no typos. The keys should be \"id\", \"name\", and \"age\", each with their respective values. Since all validations pass, the tool call should be valid.\n\nNow, wrapping the JSON in the tool call format as specified. Use the function name 'join' and include the parameters properly. Check the example provided earlier to ensure the syntax is correct. The tool call should start and end with the correct identifiers. Everything looks good. I'll output the tool call request as instructed.\n",
