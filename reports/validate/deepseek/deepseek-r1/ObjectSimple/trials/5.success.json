          "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The user provided information about a member joining a channel. The member's ID is \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name is \"Eulchan Kim\", and age is 20.\n\nI need to use the 'join' function here. Let me check the parameters for the join function. The parameters require an object with id, name, and age. The id is a UUID, which the user provided. The name is a string, which is given as \"Eulchan Kim\". The age has a minimum of 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. The user says the age is 20, which meets the minimum but is exactly 20. Wait, the schema says \"exclusiveMaximum\":100, so 99 is the max. But the age here is 20, which is valid because it's the minimum. So that's okay.\n\nSo I need to construct the JSON object with these values. Let me put it all together. The ID is correct, name is correct, age is 20. All required fields are present. So the tool call should be the join function with those parameters.\n\nI should format the tool call as specified. Start with <tool_calls_begin>, then each tool call within <tool_call_begin> tags. The function name is join, then the JSON parameters. Let me make sure the JSON is correctly formatted. No typos in the UUID, quotes around strings. Age is an integer without quotes. That should do it.\n",
