The member's details are given: ID is \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name is \"Eulchan Kim\", and age is 20. The tool to use here is the 'join' function. \n\nFirst, I need to check the parameters required for the 'join' function. The parameters schema specifies that we need an object with 'id', 'name', and 'age'. The 'id' must be a UUID, which the user provided correctly. The 'name' is a string, which is \"Eulchan Kim\". The 'age' is an integer with a minimum of 20 and exclusive maximum of 100. The given age is 20, which meets the criteria.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the tool call should include all three required parameters. I'll structure the JSON object accordingly, ensuring the types match. No optional parameters are mentioned, so I don't need to include anything else. Let me verify each field again to make sure there are no mistakes. The ID is a valid UUID format, the name is a string, and the age is an integer within the specified range. Everything looks good. Time to format the tool call as per the example provided.\n",
