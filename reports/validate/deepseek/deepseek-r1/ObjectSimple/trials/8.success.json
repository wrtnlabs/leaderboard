The member's details are given: ID is \"447d9924-5dad-49ac-bcf0-84c1ada062b3\", name is \"Eulchan Kim\", and age is 20.\n\nFirst, I need to use the 'join' function. The parameters for this function require an object with id, name, and age. The ID has to be a UUID, which the user provided. The name is a string, which is there. The age needs to be an integer, and the user mentioned 20. The schema also specifies that age must be at least 20 and less than 100. Since 20 is the minimum and exclusive maximum is 100, 20 is valid.\n\nI should structure the JSON accordingly. Check if all required fields (id, name, age) are present. Yes, they are. The ID is in the correct UUID format. The age meets the constraints. So, the tool call should include all three parameters properly formatted.\n",
