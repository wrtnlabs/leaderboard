Each field in the interface is converted to the corresponding JSON schema type.\n   - `id`, `email`, `name`, `hobbies.id`, `hobbies.name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` are all represented as strings with optional formats (\"uuid\", \"email\", and \"date-time\").\n   - `age` is a number with minimum and maximum constraints.\n   - `hobbies` is an array of objects with `id` and `name` fields, each with their own constraints.\n   - `deleted_at` is represented as a `oneOf` type that can be either `null` or a \"date-time\" string.\n\n2. The schema is wrapped in a `collectSchema` call with a title (e.g., \"Member\") for reuse purposes.\n\nThe final JSON schema for the `IMember` type, encapsulated for reuse via `collectSchema`, is represented as follows:\n\n```typescript\ncollectSchema({\n  schema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" },\n      name: { type: \"string\" },\n      email: { type: \"string\", format: \"email\" },\n      age: { type: \"number\", minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: 100 },\n      hobbies: {\n        type: \"array\",\n        items: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            id: { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" },\n            name: { type: \"string\" }\n          },\n          required: [\"id\", \"name\"]\n        }\n      },\n      created_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" },\n      updated_at: { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" },\n      deleted_at: {\n        oneOf: [\n          { type: \"null\" },\n          { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    required: [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  title: \"Member\"\n});\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"uuid\"\n      },\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"email\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"email\"\n      },\n      \"age\": {\n        \"type\": \"number\",\n        \"minimum\": 20,\n        \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n      },\n      \"hobbies\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"id\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\",\n              \"format\": \"uuid\"\n            },\n            \"name\": {\n              \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n        }\n      },\n      \"created_at\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"date-time\"\n      },\n      \"updated_at\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"date-time\"\n      },\n      \"deleted_at\": {\n        \"oneOf\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"null\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"date-time\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Member\"\n}\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe JSON schema for the `IMember` type, formatted for reuse with `collectSchema`, is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n      \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" },\n      \"email\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"email\" },\n      \"age\": { \"type\": \"number\", \"minimum\": 20, \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100 },\n      \"hobbies\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"items\": {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"id\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uuid\" },\n            \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n        }\n      },\n      \"created_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n      \"updated_at\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" },\n      \"deleted_at\": {\n        \"oneOf\": [\n          { \"type\": \"null\" },\n          { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"date-time\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  \"title\": \"Member\"\n}\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Member}} is the title under which the schema is collected for reuse.\n\nThe schema is now structured and ready for integration into any system that expects JSON schema definitions, with all fields and constraints accurately represented. The `collectSchema` function can be called with this schema object to store and reuse it as needed.\n\n```typescript\ncollectSchema({\n  schema: {...}, // the schema object above\n  title: \"Member\"\n});\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the schema adheres to the OpenAPI v3.1 specifications while accurately reflecting the original TypeScript interface. The schema is designed to be both machine-readable and human-editable, facilitating easier integration and maintenance in API documentation or backend services.\n\nThus, the final collected schema is as shown above. For direct use, you would pass this object to the `collectSchema` function as demonstrated. This allows for the schema to be reused across different parts of your application or shared between services.\n\n### JSON Schema for IMember\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\n    },\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"email\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"email\"\n    },\n    \"age\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 20,\n      \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n    },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"id\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"uuid\"\n          },\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"updated_at\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"oneOf\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"null\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"format\": \"date-time\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\n    \"id\",\n    \"name\",\n    \"email\",\n    \"age\",\n    \"hobbies\",\n    \"created_at\",\n    \"updated_at\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAnd the collection for reuse would be:\n\n```typescript\ncollectSchema({\n  schema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      \"id\": { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" },\n      \"name\": { type: \"string\" },\n      \"email\": { type: \"string\", format: \"email\" },\n      \"age\": { type: \"number\", minimum: 20, exclusiveMaximum: 100 },\n      \"hobbies\": {\n        type: \"array\",\n        items: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            \"id\": { type: \"string\", format: \"uuid\" },\n            \"name\": { type: \"string\" }\n          },\n          required: [\"id\", \"name\"]\n        }\n      },\n      \"created_at\": { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" },\n      \"updated_at\": { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" },\n      \"deleted_at\": {\n        oneOf: [\n          { type: \"null\" },\n          { type: \"string\", format: \"date-time\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    required: [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  title: \"Member\"\n});\n```\\boxed{\\text{collectSchema(\\{ schema: \\ldots, title: \"Member\" \\})}} is the collected schema for reuse.

          "reasoning": "think\nOkay, I have this TypeScript interface called `IMember` and I need to convert it into a JSON schema. Let's break it down field by field.\n\nFirst, there's the `id` field. It's a string with a format of \"uuid\". In JSON schema, we can represent this as a string type with the format \"uuid\". But, looking at the provided schema definitions, there's no direct `Format` type, but there's a `string` type with a `format` field. So, for the `id`, it would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"format\": \"uuid\"\n}\n```\n\nNext, the `name` field is straightforward. It's just a string:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `email` field is a string with a format of \"email\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"format\": \"email\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `age` field is a number with two tags: `Minimum<20>` and `ExclusiveMaximum<100>`. In JSON schema, we can represent the minimum and maximum constraints for numbers. The `Minimum<20>` suggests that the minimum value is 20, and `ExclusiveMaximum<100>` means the maximum value is exclusive, so it's less than 100.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"number\",\n  \"minimum\": 20,\n  \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n}\n```\n\nThe `hobbies` field is an array of objects. Each object inside the array has an `id` (a uuid string) and a `name` (string). So, the schema for an item in the hobbies array would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\n    },\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n}\n```\n\nSince `hobbies` is an array of these objects, the array schema would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"array\",\n  \"items\": {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"id\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"format\": \"uuid\"\n      },\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are both strings with a format of \"date-time\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"string\",\n  \"format\": \"date-time\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `deleted_at` field is a bit more complex. It's a union type: it can either be `null` or a string with a \"date-time\" format. In JSON schema, we can represent this using `oneOf`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"oneOf\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"null\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNow, putting it all together, the full JSON schema for `IMember` would be:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"uuid\"\n    },\n    \"name\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"email\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"email\"\n    },\n    \"age\": {\n      \"type\": \"number\",\n      \"minimum\": 20,\n      \"exclusiveMaximum\": 100\n    },\n    \"hobbies\": {\n      \"type\": \"array\",\n      \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"id\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"uuid\"\n          },\n          \"name\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\"]\n      }\n    },\n    \"created_at\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"updated_at\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"format\": \"date-time\"\n    },\n    \"deleted_at\": {\n      \"oneOf\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"null\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"format\": \"date-time\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n}\n```\n\nBut looking back at the TypeScript interface, all fields are required except for `deleted_at` which can be `null`. The `required` field in JSON schema lists properties that must be present in the object. Since `deleted_at` can be `null` (which means it's optional to include in the object or can be present with a null value), but in TypeScript, unless marked as optional, properties are required. However, with the union type `null | ...`, it's still required to be present in some form (either null or a date-time string). But in JSON schema terms, if it's required to be present (even if it can be null), it should be in the `required` list.\n\nBut looking at the interface definition, all properties are required in the sense that they must be present in the object (even if some can be `null`). In TypeScript, non-optional properties must be present, but can have any value of their type. Since `deleted_at` is `null | (string & ...)`, it must be present, but can be `null`. So, in JSON schema, we'd include `deleted_at` in the `required` list.\n\nBut, in JSON if a property is present and set to `null`, it's still present. So, since the property is required in TypeScript (it can't be omitted, but can be null), it should be in the `required` array. However, in JSON schema, `required` means the property must be present (not necessarily non-null). So in this case, all fields in the TypeScript interface are required (even if they can be null), so they should all be in the `required` array in the JSON schema.\n\nBut, in the provided schema definitions, there's no indication of `required` being different for nullable fields. So, the initial assumption holds: all fields are required in the JSON schema because they must be present in the object (they just can have the value `null` in the case of `deleted_at`).\n\nBut, looking at the schema definitions again, there's mention of `additionalProperties`, but in our case, we're defining the properties explicitly, so that's not necessary here.\n\nFinally, to collect this schema for reuse, we can define it under a key in the schema object. Let's call it \"Member\".\n\nThe complete JSON schema for `IMember` is as above, and to collect it for reuse, we'd store it under the key \"Member\" in the schema object. But the problem asks to collect it using the `collectSchema` function, which expects a `schema` parameter with the schema information. So, we'd prepare the schema and then call `collectSchema` with that information.\n\nBut, actually, the task is to convert the `IMember` type to a JSON schema and collect it for reuse. The collection would involve storing this schema under a name, say \"Member\". However, the exact details of how to \"collect it for reuse\" with the provided `collectSchema` function aren't entirely clear based on the schema definition provided. The function expects a `schema` object along with other optional fields like title, description, etc.\n\nGiven that, the schema object for `IMember` would be as described above, and the `collectSchema` call might look like:\n\n```typescript\ncollectSchema({\n  schema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      // all the properties as defined above\n    },\n    required: [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  title: \"Member\",\n});\n```\n\nBut, to be precise, the `collectSchema` function seems to expect a schema object where one of the properties is `schema` (the actual schema info), and there are other optional properties like title, description, etc. So, the full call would encapsulate the schema we defined into a `schema` field within another object that also provides metadata like title, etc.\n\nGiven that, and assuming we might want to provide a title and possibly description for reuse, here's how we might structure the `collectSchema` call:\n\n```typescript\ncollectSchema({\n  schema: {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      id: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        format: \"uuid\"\n      },\n      name: {\n        type: \"string\"\n      },\n      email: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        format: \"email\"\n      },\n      age: {\n        type: \"number\",\n        minimum: 20,\n        exclusiveMaximum: 100\n      },\n      hobbies: {\n        type: \"array\",\n        items: {\n          type: \"object\",\n          properties: {\n            id: {\n              type: \"string\",\n              format: \"uuid\"\n            },\n            name: {\n              type: \"string\"\n            }\n          },\n          required: [\"id\", \"name\"]\n        }\n      },\n      created_at: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        format: \"date-time\"\n      },\n      updated_at: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        format: \"date-time\"\n      },\n      deleted_at: {\n        oneOf: [\n          {\n            type: \"null\"\n          },\n          {\n            type: \"string\",\n            format: \"date-time\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    required: [\"id\", \"name\", \"email\", \"age\", \"hobbies\", \"created_at\", \"updated_at\"]\n  },\n  title: \"Member\",\n  description: \"A member of the system with id, name, email, age, hobbies, and timestamps.\"\n});\n```\n\nHowever, since the exact details of the `collectSchema` function's expected input aren't fully clear from the provided schema definition snippet (the part after \"anyOf\" is cut off), but given the structure, it seems the `schema` field within the input object is where the actual JSON schema goes, and other fields like title and description are optional metadata.\n\nThus, the final step is to encapsulate our JSON schema definition into a `collectSchema` call with the schema as the `schema` field in the argument object, and possibly with some additional metadata like title (e.g. \"Member\")."
