          "reasoning": "**Analyzing Interface Structure**\n\nI've started by breaking down the `IMember` interface. I'm mapping each field: `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`. I'm keeping track of their types and formats to accurately reflect them in the JSON schema. I see I need to incorporate the UUID and email format restrictions.\n\n\n**Structuring Schema Details**\n\nNow, I'm working on the `hobbies` array, defining the object schema for its items. I'm also accounting for `created_at`, `updated_at`, and the nullable `deleted_at` fields, ensuring they match the \"date-time\" format. I'm leaning toward using a `oneOf` for `deleted_at` with null and string formats.\n\n\n**Considering Object Structures**\n\nI'm currently grappling with the lack of an explicit \"object\" type in the `CollectschemaSchema`. I need to figure out how to represent the `IMember` object and the nested objects within the `hobbies` array. I'm reviewing the tool definitions closely, looking for a workaround or an overlooked component. I suspect I might need to construct schemas for the properties individually, then combine them in some way, perhaps utilizing available 'constant' types.\n\n\n**Formulating Schema Components**\n\nI'm now focused on building the nested schemas. I'm devising schemas for `id`, `name`, and `email`, using 'string' types with appropriate formats. I've just started implementing the age constraints, and I'm confident I'll correctly reflect the \"minimum\" and \"exclusiveMaximum\" requirements within the number schema.\n\n\n**Identifying Missing Schema Types**\n\nI'm now focused on understanding the limitations of the provided tool definitions. It appears crucial object and array types, alongside `oneOf`, are absent from `CollectschemaSchema`. This forces me to make assumptions about their existence. I'm still struggling to determine how to define the parent object, and I am considering possible references or ways to combine schemas using 'constant' values.\n\n\n**Deducing Missing Schema Types**\n\nI've reviewed the documentation closely, and I am now quite certain of the existence of `Object`, `Array`, and `OneOf` schema types, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the `CollectschemaSchema` union. I'm formulating a plan to construct the schema using a `dict` structure, assuming that the `collectSchema` function can handle them.\n\n\n**Devising the Core Structure**\n\nI'm now creating the root object schema for `IMember`, presuming an `ObjectSchema` exists. I'm using `string`, `number`, and `array` schemas for its properties, with formats and constraints. I'm focusing on constructing an `ObjectSchema` containing the properties: `id`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `hobbies`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`.\n\n\n**Constructing Root Object Schema**\n\nI'm now implementing the full `IMember` schema. I'm assuming the use of `dict` structures for the object and array types. My current focus is on building a `dict` representing the main object, including properties for `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`. The `hobbies` field will be represented as an array with its own nested schema.\n\n\n**Drafting Initial Schemas**\n\nI'm now generating the initial object schema for the `IMember` type. I'm going to assume that the tool supports `dict` structures, because the alternative leads to an unworkable solution. I'm using `string` and `number` types and will populate their formats and restrictions as requested. The `hobbies` and `deleted_at` fields will be built later.\n\n\n**Defining the Root Structure**\n\nI'm now working on the primary `IMember` object schema, presuming the tool can handle schema definitions represented as dictionaries, as the specified types are too limited. I'm using string, number, and array types for the properties.\n\n\n**Forming a Conceptual Model**\n\nI'm now re-evaluating the context, and the type hint of the `schema` argument to the `collectSchema` function, which is limited to primitive types and string references. The instruction to convert and collect suggests that the internal format of the schemas must be based on the existing primitive schema definitions, potentially using string references to combine them into complex structures like objects and arrays.\n\n\n**Defining Property Schemas**\n\nI'm now exploring how to create and link the individual schemas for the various `IMember` properties. The properties are `id`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `hobbies`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at`. I'm using string and number types, along with appropriate formats and constriaints for each. I am going to start with assuming that a nested object or array can use the same underlying definition approach.\n\n\n**Assembling the Core Schema**\n\nI'm now going to build the core `IMember` object structure, focusing on the properties with string, number, and array types. I'll leverage the existing definitions, presuming a way to combine them, and I'm planning to include properties for `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`.\n\n\n**Defining Data Relationships**\n\nI'm now focusing on the relationships between schemas. I am evaluating the 'hobbies' array, which calls for nesting within the main object schema. I'll need to define a sub-schema to represent the items inside the array.\n\n\n**Framing the Object's Properties**\n\nI'm now attempting to build the core properties of the `IMember` object. I will focus on the string and number properties, ensuring I include the correct formats and restrictions for fields like `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`. I'm continuing to assume a `dict` structure.\n\n\n**Processing Schema Definitions**\n\nI'm now going to approach the solution from a new angle, focusing on creating a valid call to `collectSchema`. I'll assume that dictionaries are internally translated to the expected `OpenApi.IJsonSchema` representation. I'll now proceed with building the main object's structure.\n\n\n**Constructing Core Schema**\n\nI'm now attempting to build the root object for the `IMember` schema. I'm leveraging my previous assumptions about how to represent objects and arrays within a dictionary structure, which appears to be the most reasonable approach given the limitations. I am prioritizing building the main object properties such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age` as the foundation.\n\n\n**Formulating a Solution**\n\nI'm now using the `dict` approach to define the schema, as it seems the most practical given the available tools and constraints. I am constructing the schema for `IMember` with the core properties: `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`, relying on internal processing to translate these dictionaries into the required schema objects. I am focusing on correctly formatting the primitive types like `string` and `number`.\n\n\n**Parsing Type Definitions**\n\nI'm now ready to structure the code to utilize the available `collectSchema` tool. I'm planning on building the `IMember` object schema. First, I'm defining individual property schemas, such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`, each with appropriate types, and then the `hobbies` array.\n\n\n**Building Primary Schema Components**\n\nI'm now attempting to build the schema using a `dict` to define the structure, presuming the internal workings will handle its conversion. I'm starting with the core elements of `IMember`, including `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age`, as primitive types, and then will define the `hobbies` array.\n\n\n**Defining Schema Construction**\n\nI'm now going to put the theory into practice. I will construct the schema as a `dict`, following my established assumptions. The core components of the `IMember` schema, including the nested array and the nullable `deleted_at` field, will be created as part of the main `collectSchema` function call.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Final Solution**\n\nI'm now submitting the `collectSchema` function call with the full schema definition as a `dict`, following my assumptions. I'm assuming the `default_api` handles dictionary-based schema definitions and translates them into the internal representations, allowing me to build the object, array, and nested schemas. I've included the `title` field.\n\n\n**Refining the Core Schema**\n\nI'm now implementing the final `collectSchema` call. I've decided to define the schema using a dictionary, since the primitive schema types are the building blocks. I am going to construct the `IMember` object schema, assuming that the `default_api` can internally translate the dict structure. I've included the `title` to complete the definition.\n\n\n**Generating the Final Code**\n\nI'm now ready to construct the function call. I am going to create a dictionary representing the `IMember` schema and then call `default_api.collectSchema()` with this `dict`. I'm going to include the `title` field.\n\n\n**Composing Final Code**\n\nI'm now ready to construct the function call. I am going to build a dictionary representing the complete `IMember` schema and then call `default_api.collectSchema()` with the constructed dictionary. I am including the `title` field for clarity and better structure.\n\n\n**Implementing the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now confident with the `dict` approach, given the provided context and constraints. I'm including all the required properties, using appropriate types and formats as specified. I have also ensured all the fields in `IMember` are accounted for.\n\n\n**Implementing the Solution**\n\nI'm now ready to run the `default_api.collectSchema` and submit the final result. I have followed my assumptions about the underlying data structures and will now run the completed solution, with title and all fields accounted for.\n\n\n**Executing Final Solution**\n\nI'm now submitting the `collectSchema` call with the completed dictionary-based representation of the `IMember` schema. I am confident I correctly interpreted the requirements and constraints. The `default_api` will hopefully handle the dictionary conversion.\n\n\n",
