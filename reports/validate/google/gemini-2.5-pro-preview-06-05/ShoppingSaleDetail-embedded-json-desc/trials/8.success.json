Currently, I'm exploring the potential of the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function, hoping it holds the key to accessing the specific details the user seeks. This is a critical step in creating the appropriate query for this use case.\n\n\n**Pinpointing Specifics**\n\nI've identified that the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function is the right tool. Now, my focus is on the `id` parameter this function needs. I see a need to clarify the user's request and determine which specific MacBook they want info on, since multiple MacBook sales exist.\n\n\n**Formulating a Confirmation**\n\nI'm now focused on crafting a suitable response. My analysis has revealed \"Apple MacBook Pro\" as the relevant product. I plan to ask the user if they want details for this specific item, using the sale's ID. This ensures precision and alignment with the user's goal.\n\n\n",
