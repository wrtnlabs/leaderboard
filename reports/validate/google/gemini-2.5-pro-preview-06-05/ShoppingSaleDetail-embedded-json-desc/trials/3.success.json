Its description mentions retrieving detailed information, which aligns with the user's query for MacBook details. I will need to test the function to see if it fulfills the request effectively.\n\n\n**Determining Function Usage**\n\nI've analyzed the need for the `id` parameter. The user hasn't given it, so a clarifying question is necessary. I plan to show available sale IDs from a previous tool call. I will present a list of sales with their titles and IDs for ease of use, creating a streamlined interaction.\n\n\n**Defining User Interaction**\n\nI've determined the best approach is to guide the user. Since the user needs details on a MacBook but hasn't provided a sale ID, I'll prompt them for it. My plan now includes presenting the list of sales from the previous tool call, paired with corresponding IDs, to facilitate easy selection and input from the user.\n\n\n",
