My focus is to identify how it retrieves and presents \"detailed information.\" I'm dissecting the function's parameters and return values to understand its capabilities concerning product data and user queries.\n\n\n**Defining Information Retrieval**\n\nI've determined that the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function is promising for retrieving detailed product information. The key is the required `id` parameter, which, unfortunately, the user didn't provide. My next step is framing a clarifying question for the user, specifically requesting the sales ID for the MacBook to proceed. I'll include a list of potential IDs from prior results to assist them.\n\n\n",
