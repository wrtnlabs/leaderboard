My next step is to determine how to obtain the required `id` to make the tool function effectively.\n\n\n**Analyzing the User Request**\n\nI'm focusing on the user's request for \"detailed information of MacBook\". I've identified the potential tool `shoppings_customers_sales_at`, which aligns with retrieving product details. However, the critical hurdle is the missing product ID. Without knowing the specific MacBook, I can't use the tool to get the details. The need for user clarification is obvious.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Information Needed**\n\nI'm refining my approach. The user's request for \"MacBook\" details hinges on knowing the product ID. The `shoppings_customers_sales_at` tool looks ideal, but the crucial missing piece is the product's unique identifier. I've decided a direct query, like \"Which MacBook?\" is the most logical path to proceed and then I'll have the info to call the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` tool.\n\n\n",
