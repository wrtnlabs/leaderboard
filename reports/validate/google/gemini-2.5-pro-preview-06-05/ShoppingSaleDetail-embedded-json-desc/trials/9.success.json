Initially, I'm focusing on tools capable of retrieving product specifics. My attention has turned to the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function, which, if appropriate, appears like a viable means of obtaining the required information, given its stated ability to return sales with detailed data. I am working on determining its suitability.\n\n\n**Determining Parameter Values**\n\nI've identified the need for the \"id\" parameter to call the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function. I'm now analyzing the prior tool output to pinpoint the relevant sale ID, specifically the \"Apple MacBook Pro\" entry. My focus is on extracting the correct ID string from that output, to then feed it to the target function. I am aiming to be efficient.\n\n\n**Refining Function Application**\n\nI've reviewed the provided information thoroughly. It's clear that using `shoppings_customers_sales_at` is the correct path. I have the necessary ID (\"7212bc44-31f8-4571-b3e9-5362040aee50\") from a previous tool output. My next step is to construct and execute the function call with this parameter value.\n\n\n",
