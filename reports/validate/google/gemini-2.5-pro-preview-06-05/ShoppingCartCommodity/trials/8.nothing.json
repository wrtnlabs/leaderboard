Now, I am using the provided details like color (silver), RAM (16GB), storage (1TB), and language (English) to extract a precise product identification string.\n\n\n**Refining Stock Identification**\n\nI'm now methodically comparing the user's specified configuration (silver, 16GB, 1TB, English) with the product options from the API response. I'm carefully checking the choices within each stock item of the \"MacBook M3 Pro 14inch Entity\" unit to find the exact match. Successfully identified the correct stock item! The next step is to get the stock ID.\n\n\n"
