Considering this, I see that the `join` function in the `default_api` fits the bill perfectly. It's ready for execution, as I have all the required inputs.\n\n\n**Formulating the Execution**\n\nI'm now proceeding with the function call. Having verified all the prerequisites are in place, I'm preparing to invoke the `join` function. The inputs, gleaned from the user, are neatly formatted and ready to be passed. My next step is to monitor the function's output for a successful result, and then report back to the user accordingly.\n\n\n",
