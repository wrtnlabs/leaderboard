Its description promises detailed information, making it a strong candidate. My next step is to determine the required parameters for this function and how to best utilize it for the user's request for MacBook details.\n\n\n**Defining Strategy and Parameters**\n\nI've identified that `shoppings_customers_sales_at` is indeed the key. The next step is to get the correct `id` parameter. I've prepared to request this from the user by providing a list of MacBooks with their corresponding IDs. Then, I'll be ready to call the function with the user's choice.\n\n\n**Identifying Best Function**\n\nI've re-evaluated the function based on the user's request, now understanding that I need to present the user with a specific sale detail. I'm confident that the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function is the best choice, since its description specifies retrieval of sale details, which aligns with the user's needs.\n\n\n",
