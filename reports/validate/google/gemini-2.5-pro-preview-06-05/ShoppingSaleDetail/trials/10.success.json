I'm currently focused on how to best leverage this function to extract the MacBook information, including potential parameter adjustments to refine the search for the desired level of detail.\n\n\n**Determining Next Steps**\n\nI'm now devising a strategy to gather the necessary ID for the MacBook sale. Since the user hasn't provided it, my plan involves a two-step process. First, I'll retrieve a list of MacBook sales. Then, I will prompt the user for the specific ID they are interested in. This approach ensures I can utilize the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function effectively to furnish detailed information.\n\n\n**Verifying Product Selection**\n\nI've identified a specific MacBook sale using the `shoppings_customers_sales_index` function, with the ID `7212bc44-31f8-4571-b3e9-5362040aee50`. My current step is to confirm with the user whether this \"Apple MacBook Pro\" is the product they are interested in. This proactive approach aims to ensure I'm addressing the user's needs precisely before proceeding.\n\n\n**Refining Confirmation Request**\n\nI've refined my approach. Recognizing the potential for user uncertainty, I plan to explicitly ask the user to confirm the identified MacBook Pro sale and its ID before retrieving detailed data. This will be followed by a clear restatement of the ID, offering an opportunity for validation or correction.\n\n\n",
