Now I'm scrutinizing its specific parameters. I'm beginning to understand how to filter results effectively for this MacBook inquiry.\n\n\n**Defining the Next Steps**\n\nI've identified that the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function requires an `id` and that I must clarify with the user which specific MacBook sale they are interested in. Therefore, I plan to present the available MacBook options from the previous tool call, and then request the user's choice.\n\n\n**Identifying Information Needed**\n\nI've identified the need for the sale's `id`, which is essential for the `shoppings_customers_sales_at` function. I now plan to confirm with the user that a specific \"Apple MacBook Pro\" is the one they are interested in, so I can proceed and call `shoppings_customers_sales_at` with the correct `id`.\n\n\n",
