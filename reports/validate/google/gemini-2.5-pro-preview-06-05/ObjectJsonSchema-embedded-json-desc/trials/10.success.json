          "reasoning": "**Mapping User Requirements**\n\nI'm currently focused on dissecting the user's needs. It seems I must transform a TypeScript interface, specifically `IMember`, into a JSON schema. The phrase \"collect it for reusing\" signals a potential workflow involving a tool or system for managing the generated schema. I'm now beginning to look into how the `IMember` interface is constructed.\n\n\n**Detailing Schema Components**\n\nI'm now deep into the construction of the JSON schema, specifically addressing the properties within the `IMember` object. The `id`, `name`, and `email` properties are relatively straightforward. I've flagged the `age` property and its numerical constraints (minimum and exclusive maximum). I am now working on the hobbies array.\n\n\n**Formulating Array Schemas**\n\nThe `hobbies` array presents an interesting challenge. I've now defined the internal object schema for the array items, including `id` (UUID formatted string) and `name` (simple string). I am now working on the outer schema for the hobbies array itself, mapping its items to the previously created schema. The next step is to create the `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` schemas.\n\n\n**Defining `IMember` Structure**\n\nI've outlined the overall structure. Now I'm moving toward translating each `IMember` field to its JSON Schema equivalent. Using the available `CollectschemaSchema` types as guidance. I'm determining the correct JSON schema syntax for `id`, `name`, and `email`.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Schema Structure**\n\nI'm now at the critical juncture of assembling the complete JSON schema object for `IMember`. I am implementing the `oneOf` for `deleted_at`, and making sure to reference existing tool's structures for the `id`, `name`, and `email` properties. After working with `CollectschemaSchema` types, I'll assemble the full schema.\n\n\n**Building Member Properties**\n\nI'm now creating the property schemas and the larger `IMember` object structure, using available schema types. The biggest challenge is `deleted_at`, so I'm focusing on implementing the `oneOf` construct for this property. I'll then construct the schema based on the requirements.\n\n\n**Refining Tool Implementation**\n\nI'm now planning how to build the required schema objects, and what data classes to use based on the problem requirements. I will use a dictionary to represent my JSON schema. The error messages have confirmed that the schema is a valid input for `collectSchema`, as I work through converting the TypeScript interface.\n\n\n**Constructing the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now moving toward building the final Python dictionary to represent the schema, using the insights from the analysis. I'll use a dictionary for the overall `IMember` structure and nest other dictionaries for properties. I'm now also preparing the tool call using the schema that I have constructed to ensure that the tool works as expected.\n\n\n**Implementing the Final Tool Call**\n\nI'm now prepared to invoke `collectSchema` with the assembled Python dictionary representing the JSON schema. Using the dictionary structure for the `IMember` schema, I will invoke the tool and examine the output to confirm that the schema is properly created and can be utilized. I'll verify the `required` fields and `oneOf` for `deleted_at` work, and then review the response.\n\n\n**Refining the Dictionary Schema**\n\nI'm now updating the final Python dictionary to reflect the JSON schema requirements, focusing on the properties and `required` fields, and how they map to tool inputs. I will also test a dictionary input.\n\n\n**Executing Tool Calls**\n\nI'm now ready to utilize the dictionary representing the `IMember` schema as the input for the `collectSchema` tool. The tool's `schema` parameter accepts a string and the types of `CollectschemaSchema`, so I will implement the dictionary representing the full schema. I'm now ready to run the tool with the schema and examine the resulting output for the tool and verify all components work as expected.\n\n\n**Implementing Schema Translation**\n\nI'm now converting the `IMember` interface to a JSON schema object in a Python dictionary. I've confirmed the structure matches the `collectSchema` input requirements. The current focus is testing this dictionary with the `collectSchema` tool to validate the output for various types.\n\n\n**Testing the Dictionary Input**\n\nI'm now ready to test the schema tool with the final Python dictionary representing `IMember`. I've completed the schema and will now invoke `collectSchema` with this dictionary to confirm it works. I am building the dictionary and will prepare it for testing to see if the response is valid.\n\n\n",

              "reasoning": "**Refining Schema Generation**\n\nI've been focusing on the best approach to automatically generate a JSON schema from the `IMember` TypeScript interface. Currently, the goal is to create a reusable schema definition. Key considerations are correctly mapping the `id` field to a UUID format and the `email` field to an email format within the JSON schema.\n\n\n**Constructing the Object Schema**\n\nI'm currently assessing the most appropriate schema type to represent the `IMember` interface's object structure, given the constraints of the `collectSchema` function. I'm realizing there is no explicit object type, which is a major stumbling block. It is looking like I will need to compose a more complex schema by combining available types. The available primitive types seem insufficient without some more involved composition work.\n\n\n**Defining the Schema Types**\n\nI'm now focusing on the correct representation of the `IMember` interface within the JSON schema. I need to define the types for `id`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `hobbies`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` fields using available schema types. Considering the lack of an `IObject` schema, I am trying to find available types to define these fields. Specifically, the `id` and `email` fields require special formatting. I am currently making progress by assessing available schema options.\n\n\n**Composing the Object Schema**\n\nI've reviewed the schema structure again, and it's looking likely I'll need an `IObject` type. The `collectSchema` options seem limited, so I'm now assuming the availability of hidden schema types. Specifically, I will focus on creating an `IObject` type, and then defining properties within it. I am starting to look into the `properties` field and will define each field within the `IMember` interface.\n\n\n**Defining the Top-Level Schema**\n\nI've carefully reviewed the constraints and available types for the `collectSchema` function. I've now determined that I need to construct an `IObject` schema to represent `IMember`. This means defining `properties` and likely a `required` field. I'm proceeding by defining each property of the `IMember` interface and their respective schema components.\n\n\n**Composing the `IMember` Schema**\n\nI'm now constructing the complete `IMember` schema. I'm focusing on defining the `properties` field, ensuring each field within `IMember` is accurately represented using the available `CollectschemaSchema` types. The `hobbies` field is also being carefully considered; it is an array of objects and I need to make sure I can define this correctly.\n\n\n**Modeling Complex Types**\n\nI'm now focusing on how to represent the `hobbies` field, which is an array of objects. This necessitates defining an `ArraySchema` and nesting an object schema within it. Then, `deleted_at` requires a `oneOf` schema for null or date-time strings. I will next assess the best method to compose these complex schemas, given the limitations of the `collectSchema` function.\n\n\n**Composing with Assumptions**\n\nI'm now attempting to construct the JSON schema, but I'm blocked. There are no `IObject` or `IArray` types defined, even though the documentation and examples strongly suggest these are needed. I must assume the existence of unlisted `CollectschemaSchema` classes to proceed with defining `IMember`.\n\n\n**Composing with Assumptions**\n\nI'm now constructing the `IMember` schema, and I have had to assume the existence of `ObjectSchema`, `ArraySchema`, and `OneOfSchema` classes to proceed, since these are not explicitly provided. I'm continuing by defining each property, utilizing the available and assumed schema components, such as `string`, `number`, `array` and the `oneOf` schemas, in order to accurately depict the `IMember` interface.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Object Schema**\n\nI've concluded that creating the `IMember` schema necessitates composing various schema components, including `object`, `array`, and `oneOf` types. I've had to assume their existence, which is not explicitly provided. These must be defined within the `properties` of an `IObject`. I'm now constructing the `IObject` with its `properties`.\n\n\n**Mapping `IMember` Fields**\n\nI've moved on to mapping the `IMember` interface's individual fields to their corresponding schema types. The most important consideration is the type mapping for the `id`, `email`, and `age` fields. I'm focused on ensuring correct JSON schema types and formats are used, such as `uuid` and `email`. The use of `oneOf` schema and array of objects is now the central focus.\n\n\n**Final Schema Composition**\n\nI've constructed the final JSON schema by carefully composing several assumed types, specifically including the crucial `CollectschemaSchema5` (Array), `CollectschemaSchema6` (Object), and `CollectschemaSchema8` (OneOf) classes. I am now defining `properties` and required fields. The final step is composing the `IMember` schema using available primitives and the composed object/array schemas.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Tool's Capabilities**\n\nI've shifted my focus to the limitations of the `collectSchema` function. While I can define the schema components for `IMember`, the lack of `ObjectSchema`, `ArraySchema`, and `OneOfSchema` makes direct composition impossible. My new approach is to re-evaluate what I *can* do with the available types and assume that some hidden types or methods are used internally.\n\n\n**Defining the Top-Level Schema**\n\nI've shifted my focus to the initial steps required to compose the JSON schema. It's crucial to define the structure of the `IMember` object, which demands creating an `IObject` schema. However, the available type options are limited.\n\n\n**Reassessing Tool Limitations**\n\nI'm currently taking a step back to reassess the capabilities of the provided `collectSchema` function. While I can construct the schema components for `IMember`, the absence of the assumed schema types prevents direct composition. I'm attempting to redefine what's possible by only using available types, assuming the functionality is provided internally.\n\n\n**Mapping Interface Properties**\n\nI'm now focused on taking the `IMember` interface fields and precisely translating each one to its corresponding schema representation. Considering the limitations of the tool, I must ensure that the mappings align precisely with what is available, particularly regarding the `id`, `email`, and `age` properties. The `oneOf` schema and arrays of objects are the core challenges now.\n\n\n**Analyzing Possible Implementations**\n\nI'm now evaluating the available tooling options and what's possible given the constraints. I need to identify how to represent the complex `IMember` schema with the limited types available. The most significant challenge is the lack of object and array types, which I need to represent the interface correctly.\n\n\n**Defining Schema Components**\n\nI'm now attempting to utilize the `collectSchema` function to create the required `IMember` schema. The crucial step is defining the structure, which I am trying to do piece by piece by using the available `CollectschemaSchema` types. Since the object structure of `IMember` is complex, the absence of object or array types is a problem.\n\n\n**Reassessing Schema Generation**\n\nI'm now going back to the beginning, focused on the available types for the `collectSchema` function. I've reviewed the `IMember` interface and the expected output, which will be a JSON schema. I'm attempting to figure out how to fit the known types to the required output, or if I will need to assume some internal implementation details.\n\n\n**Analyzing Tool Constraints**\n\nI'm facing a critical constraint: the limited types for schema generation. The absence of `ObjectSchema` and other core types makes it difficult to create a valid, complete schema. I need a workaround, and I will focus on the available types in order to define this interface.\n\n\n**Composing the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now formulating the `IMember` JSON schema, integrating various assumed schema types: `CollectschemaSchema6` for objects, `CollectschemaSchema5` for arrays, and `CollectschemaSchema8` for `oneOf`. It necessitates composing `properties`, `required` fields, and ensuring correct type mappings, including handling `id`, `email`, `age`, and `hobbies`.\n\n\n**Mapping the `IMember` Schema**\n\nI'm now focusing on assembling the final `IMember` schema. Given the limitations, it demands a careful composition of the assumed types. This involves defining the properties, including handling arrays and the `oneOf` for `deleted_at`. Correct type mappings for the `id`, `email`, and `age` fields are crucial for successful generation.\n\n\n**Assessing Tool Functionality**\n\nI'm currently trying to reconcile the user's request with the capabilities of `collectSchema`. The apparent absence of key schema types like objects and arrays, and the limited provided schema options, presents a significant hurdle to correct schema generation.\n\n\n**Defining the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now attempting to construct the complete schema based on the `IMember` interface. I'm combining all the pieces: the `id`, `name`, and `email` string fields; the `age` number field; the array of hobbies and `deleted_at` fields. I am now focusing on the correct composition of the schema, given the available and assumed tool options.\n\n\n**Formulating a Solution**\n\nI'm now designing the JSON schema using the available tool and assuming I can compose it from known types. The primary challenge is the absence of an explicit object schema, which I will address. My focus is on creating the top-level object schema by mapping `IMember` interface properties to `CollectschemaSchema` types.\n\n\n",
