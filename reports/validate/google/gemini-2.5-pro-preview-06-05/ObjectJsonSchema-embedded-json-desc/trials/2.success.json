          "reasoning": "**Defining Schema Generation**\n\nI've started to outline the process of converting the `IMember` interface into a JSON schema. The plan is to focus on each field, specifying its type and format. Currently, I'm focusing on the `id`, `name`, `email`, and `age` fields, using \"uuid,\" \"email,\" and \"number\" respectively. The challenge lies in handling the various formats appropriately.\n\n\n**Mapping Interface Properties**\n\nI'm now mapping out the `hobbies` array, a key part of this schema. Each item within the array is an object with `id` and `name` fields, each requiring their own schema definitions. The `created_at`, `updated_at` and `deleted_at` date-time fields are up next.\n\n\n**Formulating Schema Structure**\n\nI'm now translating the `IMember` interface into a concrete JSON schema, starting with the top-level structure. The `id`, `name`, `email` and `age` fields will be straightforward string, number, and email mappings, respectively. More intricate are the `hobbies` and the date-time fields. The `deleted_at` field requires special handling for `null` values using the `oneOf` strategy, as the tool doesn't natively support nullable fields.\n\n\n**Analyzing Schema Properties**\n\nI'm now focusing on the `age` field, setting `minimum` to 20 and `exclusiveMaximum` to 100. Next, I'm working on the complex `hobbies` array, designing the nested object schema that defines its items, mapping the `id` and `name` fields. The `deleted_at`'s handling using `oneOf` remains a focal point.\n\n\n**Constructing the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now composing the complete JSON schema. I've mapped the interface's properties to their schema counterparts, including the `uuid`, `email`, and `date-time` formats. The `oneOf` strategy for `deleted_at` will need to be used. The lack of native support for some types in the tool is making me consider a workaround, perhaps a simple nested dictionary with the necessary schema definitions.\n\n\n**Refining Schema Generation**\n\nI'm now constructing the JSON schema object, focusing on the `hobbies` array and the `deleted_at` field, which poses the most challenges given the tool's limitations. It lacks native support for nullable fields, so I'll use `oneOf`. The data model also needs the required properties.\n\n\n**Implementing The Schema**\n\nI'm now constructing the complete JSON schema as a dictionary. I'll be mapping the `IMember` interface properties to their corresponding schema counterparts using the `CollectschemaSchema` tools. I need to handle the array and `oneOf` for `deleted_at` specifically. The  definition of  the tool shows that `object` and `array` types must be represented via nested definitions.\n\n\n**Assembling the Schema**\n\nI'm now creating the complete JSON schema as a Python dictionary, and using `CollectschemaSchema4` to map the string types. I am also creating schema definitions for `oneOf`, `object`, and `array` using the dictionary as well. I believe these dictionary structures are permissible, despite not explicitly defined in the limited tool definition.\n\n\n**Constructing the Final Schema**\n\nI'm now converting the entire interface into a dictionary format, handling nested structures for the `hobbies` array using an `items` object. The `deleted_at` field, requiring the `oneOf` strategy, is also constructed using the provided documentation for the `collectSchema` tool and the available components. I'm using the provided schema components and the existing documentation for the tool.\n\n\n**Generating the Complete Schema**\n\nI'm now preparing to use the full schema dictionary with the `collectSchema` tool. I've meticulously built the schema including the `hobbies` array, the `deleted_at` field using `oneOf`, and all the data types. I have confirmed the entire schema is in the expected format, and I'm ready to pass it as a single dictionary.\n\n\n",
